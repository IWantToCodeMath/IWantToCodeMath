- 👋 Hi, I’m @IWantToCodeMath
- 👀 I’m interested in coding to make IDE applications that help in "coding" simulations for mathematics, specifically for equation to diagram, one diagram type to another, and diagram to equation, should it be possible.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding from scratch. I know basic low-level programming as I have tried making projects in Arduino for my bachelor's degree in mechatronics engineering, as well as PLC programming (function block diagram). Currently, I teach basic engineering mathematics and allied sciences, hence my interest.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basic coding projects that will lead me to my current interest (how to make an IDE for "simulations" involving mathematics).
- 📫 You may reach me via email: gilaugusto4ifsu@gmail.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The codes I used to write were "bulky" in the sense that they always have extra characters since I want my code to be easier to debug, e.g. I write 2*3^2 as 2*(3^2) to remind me of the "correct" formula I am using, tho they are essentially the same.
